# 🧠 SQL CASE STUDY
Hotel Review Analytics – Retention & Performance Risk Analysis (SQL)

# 📌 Business Context

Online hotel platforms rely heavily on customer reviews to drive retention, bookings, and revenue.
However, high review volume does not always translate to high customer satisfaction.

This case study uses SQL to analyze hotel review data and identify performance risks, sentiment patterns, and improvement opportunities using a single large fact table, similar to real-world analytics environments.

# 🎯 Business Problem Statement

Identify hotels at risk of customer churn and revenue loss by detecting anomalies in review volume, customer satisfaction, and sentiment trends over time.

# 💡 KEY BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

~Prioritize hotels with high reviews + low ratings for retention-focused interventions
~Monitor sentiment and rating trends monthly to catch early churn signals
~Use review length + sentiment as leading indicators of dissatisfaction
~Apply region-specific service strategies based on reviewer behavior

# 📈 QUANTITATIVE IMPACT (Simulated, Interview-Ready)

~Identified high-risk hotels affecting potential retention and revenue
~Enabled early detection of satisfaction decline trends
~Reduced manual analysis effort by ~60–70%
~Improved decision-making speed using SQL-driven insights
